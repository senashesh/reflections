Some Terms
> commits are a snapshot of every file in a repository at the time the commit was made

Question1
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
>>ofcourse it is easy to compare then having to rely solely on remembering things. 

Question2
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
>>lets hope so..

Question3
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
>> Pros: commit can be just right and meaningful
   Cons: sometime you forget to commit- human error

Question4
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
>>Git was especially made for coding. 

Question 5
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
>>git log gives the log of all the previous commits to the repository(multiple files)
	git diff compares the difference between two files identified by their ids.

Question 6
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
>version control helps to switch back in time when certain bugs were introduced. further more u can compare the difference in the files which makes it even easier to find out the bug.
