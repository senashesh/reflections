What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
> the files in ur repository are ready to be processed by git. git creates and index of ur files in the repository and the files are hidden
under the name .

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
>diff from working directory coz files have to be added to staging area from working directory manually via add command.
 diff from repository coz the files are not yet committed hence not part of repository yet.
 the value it provides is that u can choose which files to add to repository from the working directory and also provides 
 flexibility and precautions so that you dont do some accidental mistakes in your git project
