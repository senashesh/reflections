When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
>>when u would want to share or collaborate ur projects with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
>>u might not want to be bothered with small changes. or u might have taken a break and want to update ur local version with the latest version of the project. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
>>clones are a copy of the repository from the github site. fork is also a copy of the repository from the github site but the difference is that
it is stored in ur github website. branches are comprised of different commits u create in ur project oganised in a meaningful way.
